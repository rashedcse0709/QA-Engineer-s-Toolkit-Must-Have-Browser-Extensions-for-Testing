# QA-Engineer-s-Toolkit-Must-Have-Browser-Extensions-for-Testing
--------------------------------------------------------------------
As a QA Engineer, having the right tools can make all the difference in our daily work. Here are some browser extensions that I use for testing and debugging: 

1. Fake Filler: Fake Filler is a time-saver when testing forms. It automatically fills input fields with dummy data, perfect for stress-testing forms without manually entering information every time. It's especially useful for repetitive form testing, allowing you to simulate various test cases quickly.

2. SelectorsHub - XPath Helper: SelectorsHub simplifies writing and testing XPath and CSS selectors. It auto-suggests selectors, making it easier for QA engineers to locate elements in complex DOM structures. A great tool for improving efficiency in writing automated test scripts.

3. BlazeMeter: BlazeMeter is a powerful performance testing extension that allows QA engineers to create and run load and functional tests directly from the browser. It supports JMeter, Selenium, and other popular testing frameworks, making it ideal for testing APIs, websites, and mobile apps at scale. 

4. Page Ruler Redux: Page Ruler Redux is perfect for measuring elements on a webpage. It lets you draw a ruler across a web page to check the dimensions of elements, padding, and margins. A great tool to verify if UI elements are aligned properly according to design specs. 

5. WhatFont: WhatFont helps QA engineers quickly identify fonts on a webpage. This is particularly useful for checking font consistency and design specifications during UI testing.

6. Lighthouse: Lighthouse by Google is a website auditing tool built into Chrome DevTools. It provides comprehensive reports on website performance, accessibility, SEO, and more. It’s an excellent extension for ensuring that websites meet high-quality standards. 

7. Check My Links: Check My Links is a simple but effective tool that scans web pages for broken links. As a QA engineer, ensuring that all links function correctly is a small but crucial task, and this extension simplifies that process.

8. Window Resizer: Window Resizer helps you quickly test your website's responsiveness by resizing your browser to different screen resolutions. It’s an essential extension for ensuring that your website works perfectly across devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
